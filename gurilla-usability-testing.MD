# Testing Summation

## Test 01

1.  The first user noted the 'Plan Your Trip' page seemed cluttered and list fonts were too small and cramped.

**Actionable**, increase white space around text and between sections.


2. The FAQ page answers should be hidden so you don't have to scan as much text.

**Actionable**, use drop downs for FAQ questions


## Test 02

1. Experiences page scrollbar did not reach the bottom

**Not Actionable**, wireframing mistake will not translate to prototype

2. Home page image seemed too large

**Not Actionable**, Presentation mode does not display dimensions properly. Hero image will have a height of 100vh and will fill the entire viewport, will look much better in production.

## Test 03

1. Also noted the 'Plan Your Trip' page was cluttered.

**Actionable** See Test 01

2. Ugly font

**Not Actionable** No option to choose font in Balsmiq. Agree it's ugly.
